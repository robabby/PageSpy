## PageSpy
### An Android Experiment

#### About
PageSpy is an Android focused application (for now).  Built with PhoneGap, and tapping into the YQL query language, PageSpy aims to offer web and mobile developers a quick and easy method to view source code of any webpage they submit to the application.

#### Open Source
PageSpy is an open source endeavor.  If you feel compelled to get involved, fork me!
